this applies the same to dev-lang/rust too:

the highest package version seen is limited(masked) by /etc/portage/package.mask/firefox
that's why it doesn't pick a higher version from "gentoo" repo instead!
wish that 'priority' thing would work (mentioned in: man portage) as I thought
it would, but two package names with diff. version are considered different
packages, ergo, prio is irrelevant for this case! only affects same version
package: so 'localrepo' is picked first(higher prio) above 'gentoo' which is
what we want because same package(&ver) existing in 'localrepo' compared to
'gentoo' means it's a modified version.

don't forget to get latest ebuild for virtual/rust too!
